  abstract={One of the more recent avenues towards more flexible installations and execution is the transition from monolithic architecture to microservice architecture. In such architecture, where microservices can be more liberally updated, relocated, and replaced, building liquid software also becomes simpler, as adaptation and deployment of code is easier than when using a monolithic architecture where almost everything is connected. In this paper, we study this type of transition. The objective is to identify the reasons why the companies decide to make such transition, and identify the challenges that companies may face during this transition. Our method is a survey based on different publications and case studies conducted about these architectural transitions from monolithic architecture to microservices. Our findings reveal that typical reasons moving towards microservice architecture are complexity, scalability and code ownership. The challenges, on the other hand, can be separated to architectural challenges and organizational challenges. The conclusion is that when a software company grows big enough in size and starts facing problems regarding the size of the codebase, that is when microservices can be a good way to handle the complexity and size. Even though the transition provides its own challenges, these challenges can be easier to solve than the challenges that monolithic architecture presents to company.},

  title={Investigating differences in response time and error rate between a monolithic and a microservice based architecture},
  url={http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-264840},
  abstractNote={With great advancements in cloud computing, the microservice
 architecture has become a promising architectural style for enterprise
 software. It has been proposed to cope with problems of the traditional
 monolithic architecture which includes slow release cycles, limited scalability
 and low developer productivity. Therefore, this thesis aims to investigate the
 affordances and challenges of adopting microservices as well as the difference
 in performance compared to the monolithic approach at one of Sweden’s largest
 banks, SEB - the Scandinavian Individual Bank.The investigation consisted of a
 literature study of research papers and official documentation of
 microservices. Moreover, two applications were developed and deployed using two
 different system architectures - a monolithic architecture and a microservice
 architecture. Performance tests were executed on both systems to gather
 quantitative data for analysis. The two metrics investigated in this study were
 response time and error rate.The results indicate the microservice architecture
 has a significantly higher error rate but a slower response time than the
 monolithic approach, further strengthening the results of Ueda et. al. [47] and
 Villamizar et. al. [48]. The findings have then been discussed with regards to
 the challenges and complexity involved in implementing distributed systems.
 From this study, it becomes clear the complexity shifts from inside the
 application out towards infrastructure with a microservice architecture.
 Therefore, microservices should not be seen as a silver bullet. Rather, the
 type of architecture is highly dependent on the scope of the project and the
 size of the organization.},
