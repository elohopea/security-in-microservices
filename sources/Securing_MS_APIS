Securing Microservice APIs by Scott Morrison; Matt McLarty; Rob Wilson Published by O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2018 

CH1
MS =
Service orientation
Independent deployability and manageability
Ephemerality and elasticity (instances short lived, multiple instances of single service, dynamic)
Web API communication
Container based deployments
12 -factor app/MSA
API Endpoint
API Intermediary (proxy, gateway etc.)
Service instance
"IAAA" - Identification, Access control, Authorization, Accountability or Auditing
Management automation - machine accessible interfaces
Performance - processing latency of each component
Usability for developers

CH2
OAuth, OpenID
Trust
Compromise
Network-level controls - control access to the network. Difficult to maintain. Catastrophic failure if compromised.
	Localhost Isolation
	Network Segmentation
	SSL/TLS - all APIs should use SSL/TLS everywhere.
	The Secure Production Identity Framework For Everyone (SPIFFE)
	X509
	SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Documents (SVID's)
Application-Level Controls
	security tokens - trusted third party issues, Shared secret or public-key cryptography
	SAML - federation - XML SOAP - horrid
 	modern tokens - json
	API keys - embedded in application code - unsafe - identify app not user
	OAuth 2.0 - secure authorization framework
	OpenID Connect - Authentication layer on top of OAuth - issues and ID token
	Opaque vs transparent tokens
	JWT
	Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC)
	JWT Session - bad
	JOSE - Issues
Infrastructure
	Proxy/Gateway
	Runtime Sercive Discovery
	Network Overlay - for cloud infra
	PaaS
	Kubernetes - platform for run time container management cluster-node-pod-container
	Cloud Foundry
	AWS - IaaS -proprietary AWS IAM etc.
Emerging Approaches
	fads
	Abstraction 
	Platforms
	Open Policy Agent (OPA)
	Service Mesh - e.g. Istio
	Serverless Computing - e.g. AWS Lambda
